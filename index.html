<p>A fast, <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4180">RFC 4180</a>-conforming CSV reading library for .NET.  Written in C#.</p>
<p>Fully supports all UTF-8 encoded byte streams.</p>
<ul>
<li>Other encodings will work as well, as long as the bytes <code>0x0A</code>, <code>0x0D</code>, <code>0x22</code>, and <code>0x2C</code> are all guaranteed to mean the same thing that they mean in ASCII / UTF-8, and as long as the encoding defines no other byte sequences which identify the Unicode code points for <code>'\n'</code>, <code>'\r'</code>, <code>'&quot;'</code>, or <code>','</code>, respectively.</li>
<li>In practice, this means that most &quot;Extended ASCII&quot; code pages will probably work, probably including all SBCS.  Many &quot;Extended ASCII&quot; DBCS will probably work too, but it looks like Shift-JIS will <em>not</em> work.</li>
<li>Notably, this library will fail to yield the correct result when used with byte streams encoded in any variant of UTF-16 or UTF-32, even with a BOM header.  If you require that support, there are other libraries that should work for you.</li>
</ul>
<p>Fully supports all streams that completely conform to the RFC 4180 format, and defines rules for how to handle streams that break certain rules of RFC 4180 in a way that seems to be consistent with other popular tools, at a minor speed penalty.</p>
<p>This library exists because the original developer was unsatisfied with the performance characteristics of raw CSV processing tools.  Everything out there seemed to have some combination of these flaws:</p>
<ol>
<li>Tons of managed heap allocations on hot paths, often baked into the API requirements</li>
<li>Decoding to UTF-16LE <strong>before</strong> scanning for critical bytes, which could be considered a subset of:</li>
<li>The design forces a ton of processing to happen on the input which the caller might not even care about</li>
<li>Omitting important parts of RFC 4180</li>
<li>Disappointing options for mitigating DDoS risk</li>
</ol>
<p>&quot;RFC 4180 over UTF-8&quot; is a very simple byte stream format, and the state machine requires only a few extra states to define how to handle all UTF-8 streams that are non-RFC 4180, so it seemed odd that there wasn't a reader without these flaws.</p>
<p>With Cursively,</p>
<ol>
<li>each stream only strictly requires a grand total of two objects to be allocated on the managed heap*,
<ul>
<li>*in case this is too much, both could be reset and put into a pool to be reused for processing other streams</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>processing happens directly on the input bytes (no decoding is done by Cursively itself),</li>
<li>the only processing that Cursively necessarily does is the bare minimum needed to describe the data to the caller,</li>
<li>inputs that conform to RFC 4180* are processed according to all the rules of RFC 4180, and
<ul>
<li>*inputs that do not conform to RFC 4180 are handled according to consistent, intuitive rules</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>there is a very low risk* of DDoS directly from using Cursively, and the caller has the tools that they need in order to prevent (or respond to) attacks in a more &quot;natural&quot; way than other CSV libraries that the developer has seen.
<ul>
<li>*There is no such thing as &quot;risk-free&quot; in our world.  Cursively itself cannot eliminate the risk of attacks that use it as a vector to exploit defects in CoreFX / C# compiler / runtime / OS / hardware.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Future enhancements may add support for byte streams in other encodings if there's demand for it, but not at the expense of anything that matters to the &quot;RFC 4180 over UTF-8&quot; use case.</p>
